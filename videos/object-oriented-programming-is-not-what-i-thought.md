# Object Oriented Programming is not what I thought - Anjana Vakil

Thought
- objects
- classes
- inheritance
- hierarchy

Alan Kay
- cocoiner oop
- smalltalk

Inheritance vs composition
- from cells, organs.
- self contained things of different size
-

Contrast with imperative paradigm
c
What is the big idea
- messaging - the way objects communicate
  - create big systems using messaging
- late-binding - allows for more flexible systems - runtime adaptable?

Objects
- are more like verbs - what do they do.
- how it behaves is the important thing
- How they interact

OOP more like Functional than like Imperative
