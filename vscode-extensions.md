  - You should now know how to create commands, views and how to use the API, contribution points, activation events.
- From <https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-capabilities/overview> you can find further information, like
  - Webview: <https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview>
  - Tree view: <https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/tree-view>
