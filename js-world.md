## Redux
* [mvc-is-dead-what-comes-next](https://dzone.com/articles/mvc-is-dead-what-comes-next)
* [Why use redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Motivation.html)
** Handling ever changing and complex UI state is hard!
** Mutation and asynchronicity (mentos and coke) are great in separation, but together they create a mess
** Redux is design pattern
** Redux make state mutations predictable by imposing three principles
*** Single source of truth (single store contains all application state)
*** State is read-only (emit an action)
*** Changes are made with pure functions (reducers take action + state, returns new state)
